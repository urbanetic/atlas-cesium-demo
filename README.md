Atlas-Cesium Demo
=================

This project creates a basic website to demonstrate [atlas-cesium](https://bitbucket.org/mutopia/atlas-cesium) functionality.

The project requires the cesium submodule of atlas-cesium to be updated and tag 'b23' checkout out.

Obviously this project needs to be hosted on a web server such as Apache.

You must also build `atlas-cesium` by following the README.
